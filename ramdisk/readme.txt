It contains the instructions and the batch scripts for running a 
ramdisk to help increase the performance of SWTOR in certain 
circumstances.

Credit goes to Ocmer_ and Lemon_King on the SWTOR forums for their
work in putting this together.  This is just a copy of their actual 
work with the community.


For some background on this approach, check out this thread (and 
first post) by Lemon_King:

To understand how to use these script work, read instructions.txt.


The breakdown on the batch files are as follows:

ALL-IN-ONE CACHE VERSION [1.5GB][64-bit]

 - cache.bat
 - mount-cache.bat

This only creates a ramdisk for the three cache files, nothing more.


ALL-IN-ONE CACHE+FX VERSION [1.5~2GB][64-bit]

 - cache_fx.bat
 - mount-cache_fx.bat

This creates a ramdrive for the three cache files and fx asset file.
Warning with patching appies!


ALL-IN-ONE CACHE+FX+DYNAMIC VERSION [4GB][64-bit]

 - cache_fx_dynamic.bat
 - mount-cache_fx_dynamic.bat

This creates a ramdrive for the three cache files, fx asset and the 
dynamic character asset files. Warning with patching appies!
